# Flock-You: Surveillance Device Detector

<img src="flock.png" alt="Flock You" width="300px">

**Standalone BLE surveillance device detector with web dashboard, GPS wardriving, and session persistence.**

Available as part of the OUI-SPY project at [colonelpanic.tech](https://colonelpanic.tech)

## Overview

Flock-You detects Flock Safety surveillance cameras, Raven gunshot detectors, and related monitoring hardware using BLE-only heuristics. It runs a WiFi access point with a live web dashboard on your phone, tags detections with GPS from your phone's browser, and exports everything as JSON, CSV, or KML for Google Earth.

No WiFi sniffing — the radio is dedicated to serving the dashboard AP while BLE scans continuously in the background via ESP32 coexistence.

## Detection Methods

All detection is BLE-based:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MAC prefix** | 20 known Flock Safety OUI prefixes (FS Ext Battery, Flock WiFi modules) |
| **BLE device name** | Case-insensitive substring match: `FS Ext Battery`, `Penguin`, `Flock`, `Pigvision` |
| **Manufacturer ID** | `0x09C8` (XUNTONG) — catches devices with no broadcast name. *From [wgreenberg/flock-you](https://github.com/wgreenberg/flock-you)* |
| **Raven service UUID** | Identifies Raven gunshot detectors by BLE GATT service UUIDs |
| **Raven FW estimation** | Determines firmware version (1.1.x / 1.2.x / 1.3.x) from advertised service patterns |

---

## Features

- **WiFi AP**: `flockyou` / password `flockyou123`
- **Web dashboard** at `192.168.4.1` — live detection feed, pattern database, export tools
- **GPS wardriving** — phone GPS via browser Geolocation API tags every detection with coordinates
- **Session persistence** — detections auto-save to flash (SPIFFS) every 60 seconds
- **Prior session tab** — previous session survives reboot and is viewable in the PREV tab
- **Export formats**: JSON, CSV, and KML (Google Earth) — current and prior sessions
- **Serial output** — Flask-compatible JSON over serial for live desktop ingestion
- **200 unique device storage** with FreeRTOS mutex thread safety
- **Crow call boot sounds** — modulated descending frequency sweeps with warble texture
- **Detection alerts** — ascending chirps + descending caw on new device detection
- **Heartbeat** — soft double coo every 10s while a device stays in range

## Enabling GPS (Android Chrome)

The dashboard uses your phone's GPS to geotag detections. Because it's served over HTTP, Chrome requires a one-time flag change:

1. Open a new Chrome tab and go to `chrome://flags`
2. Search for **"Insecure origins treated as secure"**
3. Add `http://192.168.4.1` to the text field
4. Set the flag to **Enabled**
5. Tap **Relaunch**

After relaunching, connect to the `flockyou` AP, open `192.168.4.1`, and tap the **GPS** card in the stats bar to grant location permission.

> **Note:** iOS Safari does not support Geolocation over HTTP. GPS wardriving requires Android with Chrome.

## Hardware

**Board:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO 3 | Piezo buzzer |
| GPIO 21 | LED (optional) |

---

## Building & Flashing

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

```bash
cd flock-you
pio run                     # build
pio run -t upload           # flash
pio device monitor          # serial output
```

**Dependencies** (managed by PlatformIO):

- `NimBLE-Arduino` — BLE scanning
- `ESP Async WebServer` + `AsyncTCP` — web dashboard
- `ArduinoJson` — JSON serialization
- `SPIFFS` — session persistence to flash

---

## Flask Companion App

The `api/` folder contains a Flask web application for desktop analysis of detection data.

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flockyou.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` for the desktop dashboard.

**Import support:** JSON, CSV, and KML files exported from the ESP32 can be imported directly into the Flask app. Live serial ingestion is also supported — connect the ESP32 via USB and select the serial port in the Flask UI.

## Raven Gunshot Detector Detection

Flock-You identifies SoundThinking/ShotSpotter Raven devices through BLE service UUID fingerprinting:

| Service | UUID | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Device Info | `0000180a-...` | Serial, model, firmware |
| GPS | `00003100-...` | Real-time coordinates |
| Power | `00003200-...` | Battery & solar status |
| Network | `00003300-...` | LTE/WiFi connectivity |
| Upload | `00003400-...` | Data transmission metrics |
| Error | `00003500-...` | Diagnostics & error logs |
| Health (legacy) | `00001809-...` | Firmware 1.1.x |
| Location (legacy) | `00001819-...` | Firmware 1.1.x |

Firmware version is estimated automatically from which service UUIDs are advertised.
